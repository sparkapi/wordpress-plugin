	<h2>Less Spam, More Speed</h2>

	<p><strong>What&#8217;s New?</strong> Captchas are becoming less effective in combatting spam, <em>and</em> studies show that visitors are less likely to complete a form with a captcha because they find it frustrating. We&#8217;ve added new spam-blocking features and removed the captcha to help you generate more leads from your website. And you don&#8217;t have to do a thing.</p>
